\title{Function to obtain block diagonal structure through thresholding}
\usage{
block_diag(R, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{a \eqn{p \times p} correlation matrix}

\item{c}{a threshold}
}
\value{
A \eqn{p} length integer vector whose \eqn{i^{th}} element denotes the group \eqn{i^{th}} variable belongs to.
}
\description{
Given a correlation matrix \eqn{R}, this function discovers the block-diagonal structure by thresholding the absolute values of the entries of the correlation matrix at \eqn{c}. We create an adjacency matrix with the elements being 1 if and only if the corresponding member of the correlation matrix has an absolute value \eqn{\ge c}. This is equivalent to performing a single linkage hierarchical clustering on the variables, with the distance matrix given by \eqn{1 - |R|} and truncating the tree at \eqn{1-c}.

\examples{
# Simulates a 10 x 5 X from N(0, I)
set.seed(1)
X <- matrix(rnorm(50), 10, 5)
# Compute the coreelation matrix of X.
corX <- cor(X)
# Compute the block diagonal structure at c=0.5
block_diag(R=corX, c=0.5)
