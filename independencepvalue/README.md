# What does `independencepvalue` do?

`independencepvalue` is an `R` package that tests the independence
between two groups of Gaussian variables, where the groups were obtained
by thresholding the correlation matrix.

# How do I get `independencepvalue`?

We use `R` package `remotes` to install `independencepvalue` from
GitHub. If not installed, please install `remotes` by using
`install.packages("remotes")`. Next
run,

``` r
remotes::install_github("ArkajyotiSaha/independencepvalue-project", subdir = "independencepvalue")
library(independencepvalue)
```

This R package is created using literate programming with the
[litr](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project/tree/main/litr) R
package. To know more about `independencepvalue` generation, please
