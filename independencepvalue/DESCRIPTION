Description: Discovers block diagonal structure from a given covariance
    matrix through thresholding correlations and then tests whether a
    block is independent from the remaining variables in a fashion that
    accounts for the selection of the blocks.  A function for testing in
    the classical setting where these groups are predetermined is also
    implemented.
